<sub>*HOT (station ALOHA, white dot on map) oxygen data between 480 - 520 dbar
are shown as blue dots with an overlaid black moving average
line. Individual BGC Argo oxygen data (red dots on map) for the same
interval retrieved via webODV’s cross-server integration have been
overlaid (red dots plus gray moving average line). The combination of
ship-based Niskin measurements with autonomous float observations
demonstrates how webODV facilitates direct comparison of complementary
datasets without preprocessing or downloading.*

In this example we show how to use webODV's cross-server integration -
the ability to pull in data from multiple servers and overlay them in
a unified visual and analytical framework.
